InvertedIndexBuilder/Handler/Factory/whatever

	Doesn't actually help in creating InvIndex
	What it does is parse a text file(s) for its stems, and stores it into invIndex

	Could say it's a wordStemCollector

	So let's rename it to wordStemCollector

	Also it has a complex init process, so make builder pattern for this


WordStemCollector:

	private final InvertedIndex index;
	private final Path filePath;

	

	private WordStemCollector(WordStemCollectorBuilder builder):
		index = builder.index;
		filePath = builder.filePath;



	public static class WordStemCollectorBuilder:
		private InvertedIndex index;
		private Path filePath;

		public WordStemCollectorBuilder():
			set all to null

		public parsingFile(Path filePath):
			set this.filePath to filePath

		public savingTo(InvIndex index):
			this.index = index;

		public build():
			return new WordStemCollector(this);
