Uppercase stuff
	Use ALL CAPS for constant-like vars
	Can rename var by right clicking var name, clicking refactor, clicking rename
	Then changing text in var in one place changes them everywhere

Multithreading question
	Have 2 options:
		1) Make class static
		2) Make var near where you make all your vars and just reuse it
		Do it


TODO:
	Make post on Github saying:
		1) My stems test isn't working - expected: 6, only getting: 4
		2) I'm on a Windows system
