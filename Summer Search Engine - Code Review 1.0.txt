Code Review

Questions:
	1) How to Builder Pattern?
		- Want to make it easy for dev to know what each parameter does, but all of them are mandatory
		- Do I just do 4 arguments w/ no description?
		- Do I put null checks 

	2) Use of whitespace
		Is method( otherMethod() ) okay?

Exception output:
	Driver:
		Only file that interacts w/ user
		Shouldn't throw exceptions - only deal w/ them
		B/c it's from the user, EXCEPTION OUTPUT SHOULD BE FOR USERS, NOT FOR DEVS
Exception handling:
	If exception cases all do the same thing, just put them in one
		catch (Exception e)

Unmodifiable
	Can't safely return nested data - only outer layer is unmodifiable - inner one is
	
	unmodifiable keySets and toJson() from last project was the right idea

Note: %n is portable across platforms, \n is not (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1883345/whats-up-with-javas-n-in-printf)


Have to make all instances of "stem" -> "str"


New WordStemCollector:



Goal: Put all word stem collection logic into one file 
(Integrating OneFileCollector into this file)



WordStemCollector:
	private final InvertedIndex index;

	private WordStemCollector(InvertedIndex index)

	public static WordStemCollector savingStemsTo(InvertedIndex index):
		return new WordStemCollector(index);

	public void collectStemsFrom(Path path):
		Create list from this path (regardless of whether it's one file or dir)
			Chances are, will probably be dir

		For each filePath : filePaths:
			make anonclass OneFileCollector (basically does what OneFileCollector does)
			oneFileCollector.parseFile();
